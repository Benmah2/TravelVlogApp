For my exam project, my classmate and I developed a travel vlog app that connected to Firebase. 
Unfortunately, the servers are currently inactive, meaning the app isn't functional at the moment. 
Since I'm focused on other projects right now, I won't have time to address this issue, so Iâ€™ve decided to leave it as it is.
